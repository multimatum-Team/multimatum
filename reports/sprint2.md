Sprint 2 summary
================

### Florian

### Joseph

The task I was assigned was not too difficult this week, but I struggled a lot to make the CI work
properly, as a result I largely underestimated my workload.

I'm not sure how I could have anticipated this but hopefully such logistical issues won't happen too
often from now on, as we finally got most of the tooling to work.

### Lenny (Scrum master)

### LÃ©o

### Louis

I was assigned to make the log in system and the UI with it. 
It figured that i had to configure firebase to use its API.
It takes me a lot more time than expected. The code is finished but not the UI and the test.

For the next sprint i will finish this feature and done another little one. Maybe the possibility to
mark task as done or the notification system.

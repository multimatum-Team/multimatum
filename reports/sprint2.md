Sprint 2 summary
================

### Florian

### Joseph

This week I was assigned to the creation of the deadline class.
The task in itself wasn't too hard to implement but I struggled a lot to make the CI work  properly,
as a result I largely underestimated my workload.

I'm not sure how I could have anticipated this but hopefully such logistical issues won't happen too
often from now on, as we finally got most of the tooling to work.

### Lenny (Scrum master)

### LÃ©o

My goal for this week was to create a camera screen containing a QR-Code reading feature.
The camera screen was not so hard to implementin itself, but the permission managment was quite hard.
I had to learn that but it should be easier now. The QR-Code reader was relatively easy to implement
using a library, but UI testing was very hard, because a did not find a way to simulate a QR-Code
reading in the tests. So testing (and coverage) should be improved for next week.
The time estimation was good, I worked approximately one hour more than expected.

### Louis

I was assigned to make the log in system and the UI with it. 
It figured that i had to configure firebase to use its API.
It takes me a lot more time than expected. The code is finished but not the UI and the test.

For the next sprint i will finish this feature and done another little one. Maybe the possibility to
mark task as done or the notification system.

Sprint 2 summary
================

### Florian

### Joseph

The task I was assigned was not too difficult this week, but I struggled a lot to make the CI work
properly, as a result I largely underestimated my workload.

I'm not sure how I could have anticipated this but hopefully such logistical issues won't happen too
often from now on, as we finally got most of the tooling to work.

Sprint 2 summary
================

### Florian
I had for Sprint tast to allow the user of the app to generate QR Code.
Using the zxing library, the activity was implemented in 3 hours, which was a little longer than expected.
However, it was more challenging to do the tests of it than I though. I had to find a matcher
allowing me to test if the QR Code was correct. Also, I tried to use Roboelectric which give a bigger
freedom to the tests and thus lead to a better coverage. Unfortunatly, for now, Cirrus CI doesn't
detect the tests done with Roboelectric and thus I had to remove some of them, reducing the coverage.
As Roboelectric is very useful, I will try to find a way so that Cirrus CI detect it.
Adding Roboelectric and the matcher, I had in total a workload of 9 hours. Which is longer than
expected


### Joseph

This week I was assigned to the creation of the deadline class.
The task in itself wasn't too hard to implement but I struggled a lot to make the CI work  properly,
as a result I largely underestimated my workload.

I'm not sure how I could have anticipated this but hopefully such logistical issues won't happen too
often from now on, as we finally got most of the tooling to work.

### Lenny (Scrum master)

I did an UI design preview on Sketch in order to provide an preview of the app structure. 

### LÃ©o

My goal for this week was to create a camera screen containing a QR-Code reading feature.
The camera screen was not so hard to implementin itself, but the permission managment was quite hard.
I had to learn that but it should be easier now. The QR-Code reader was relatively easy to implement
using a library, but UI testing was very hard, because a did not find a way to simulate a QR-Code
reading in the tests. So testing (and coverage) should be improved for next week.
The time estimation was good, I worked approximately one hour more than expected.

### Louis

I was assigned to make the log in system and the UI with it.
It figured that i had to configure firebase to use its API.
It takes me a lot more time than expected. The code is finished but not the UI and the test.

For the next sprint i will finish this feature and done another little one. Maybe the possibility to
mark task as done or the notification system.

### Valentin
My task for this week was to setup a basic settings activity to let the user configure the app as (s)he wants.
The implementation part went quite well, and when I was about to start the testing part I was approximatively following my time estimates.
But then I had a lot of trouble with the tests. I wanted to make dependency injection to inject SharedPreferences into MainSettingsActivity.
I read documentation on frameworks like Mockito and Hilt and tried to make this work. But after trying for a (probably too) long time, I
decided to make simpler tests without dependency injection, and to ask the TAs and the rest of the group whether DI is
worth the effort. Therefore, my time estimate was much too low, because I had not anticipated the issues with DI.
I also made a very stupid mistake with Git: I created my branch for the feature from an old branch that was not up to date,
and I had to do a git rebase to fix that.

Next week I may have to retry to make this dependency injection work if the group decides that we should do it, and/or I can start working another feature,
e.g. a notification system for the app

Sprint <n> summary
================

### Florian
During this week, I have worked on the display of the time of the deadline in the ListView and in 
DeadlineDetails activity as we have implemented it last sprint. I have also added the possibility
to select the time when you create a deadline and to modify the deadline in DeadlineDetailsActivity.
For now, the modification of deadline is only on the UI so will link it the the viewModel next
sprint. I will also add a done option in the ListView in the main next week.
In general, I have a underestimated the implementation of time in AddDeadlineActivity thus I have
made more hours than expected but otherwise it was fine.

During this week I finalize the QRCode generator by cleaning the actual layout, make consistent the access to the activity and refractoring a significant part of the code. I create a new class QRGenerator used in the activity and make all associated test. It wasn't so simple to refractor this but finnaly it went fine.
I start working on the deadline sort and I finished it next week.

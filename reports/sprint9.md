Sprint 9 summary
================

### Florian

### Joseph

This week I worked on implementing the grou viewmodel which required a bunch
of refactoring in other repositories and activities. While refactoring, I spot
a few bugs which I managed to fix. Yet again, I am working on Firebase code so
my PR had a small diff-coverage (under the 50% threshold), so I chose to test
the `FirebaseDeadlineRepository` (#190) to reach the threshold. I know making
a PR this big is not a good idea but I saw no other way around the coverage
threshold, apologies to my team mates which are going to review it. Next week,
I will work on Firebase action links to enable users to invite people to their
group, and I might try to work on the UI as well.

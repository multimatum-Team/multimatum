I had 3 tasks to do this week. The first one was to disable the logging methods of LogUtil.kt when the
app is built for release (while keping them enabled when it is built for debug). For this task, my time
estimate was accurate. The second task was to split the ProcrastinationDetectorService into 2 files, so
that it becomes more readable (CodeClimate was complaining about it). This took me less time than
expected because I thought that I would have to modify the tests, but it was not the case. The third
task was to start working on a system that is able to recognize dates and times in deadline titles. I
decided to implement a parser from scratch for that purpose, because I think that finding a library that
does exactly what we need would be difficult and would take more time than a scratch implementation. It
is currently able to recognize some expressions of a time (e.g. "8am"), but it cannot recognize dates yet,
so I will have to continue working on it next sprint. I spent more time than estimated on this task.

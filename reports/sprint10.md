Sprint 10 summary
================

### Florian

### Joseph

### Lenny

### Léo

### Louis
This week I had 2 task, make a filter on the main activity and create an activity to add group. For the filter I had to use spinner, so I read a lot of documentation on it. THen Joseph and Lenny made a remark. At the begining I could filter if deadlines were mine or in a group, they suggested the possiblity to filter by individual group. It was a nice idea but it took me a lot of time to implements this way, so I didn't do the activity for group. I'll do it next week while helping Leo on the geolocalisation.

### Valentin
This week I had two main tasks. The first one was about the procrastination
fighter. I added a slider so that the user can adjust the sensitivity. It
was not too difficult in itself, even though it is not easy to interact with
the human behavior detected by the sensor, but testing took me more time than
expected because I tried complicated things before I noticed that a tiny
modification in the code would make testing much easier... My second task was
to add patterns to the parser. But when starting with this task I noticed that
the increasing number of patterns would make it easy to forget to include a
pattern into the patterns list, so I first had to create a system of
annotations to mark the patterns. Finally, during this sprint Lenny noticed
that a pattern that I wrote last week was not working, so I had to fix it.
Currently there is no task planned for me next week, we decided that we would
choose on Friday what I will be doing, once we have a clear view of what
remains to do after this sprint.

Sprint 11 summary
================

### Florian
This week, I was tasked to add custom notifications for the deadline and to show the deadline
in the calendar view. The two of them were complicated because it needed some libraries that are
difficult to test and finding a library for allowing the calendar to show the deadline was quite long
as there exist multiple of them but only a very few who can be coded in kotlin.
However, I have correctly managed my time and made just 1 hour more than expected.
Next week, I will make some tests to improve the coverage and maybe also improve the UI.

### Valentin
This week I had to help Léo with the tests of the location feature. I tried
several solutions, the first one being to force Robolectric to execute the tests
on a larger screen because we thought that the problem could be a lack of space
for widgets in `AddDeadlineActivity`. I also attempted to fix the initialization
of the library, and used logs and the debugger to try to find what was failing.
Unfortunately, after spending the planned time (4 hours) on it, I had still
not fixed anything... At that point Léo sent you the email asking for help,
and we decided that I should move to another task. Thus I had nothing to
push for this task. Then my next task was to write tests for the QR code reader.
This was more productive and for once I was able to stay within my time
estimate... Next week I will probably have to write tests to improve coverage
where we can, or to refine a feature, but the exact tasks remain to be defined.

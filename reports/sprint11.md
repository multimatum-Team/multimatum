Sprint 11 summary
================

### Florian

### Joseph

### Lenny

### Léo

### Louis

### Valentin
This week I had to help Léo with the tests of the location feature. I tried
several solutions, the first one being to force Robolectric to execute the tests
on a larger screen because we thought that the problem could be a lack of space
for widgets in `AddDeadlineActivity`. I also attempted to fix the initialization
of the library, and used logs and the debugger to try to find what was failing.
Unfortunately, after spending the planned time (4 hours) on it, I had still
not fixed anything... At that point Léo sent you the email asking for help,
and we decided that I should move to another task. Thus I had nothing to
push for this task. Then my next task was to write tests for the QR code reader.
This was more productive and for once I was able to stay within my time
estimate... Next week I will probably have to write tests to improve coverage
where we can, or to refine a feature, but the exact tasks remain to be defined.

Sprint <n> summary
================

### Florian

At the beginning of the sprint, I have updated the bootcamp in hope to made the CI correctly detect the coverage.
However, this fix wasn't enough so I had to find another way to correct it. Now the CI detects correctly the coverage,
which improve our coverage by almost 10% with all the tests previously not detected. Unfortunatly, after the fixes,
I hadn't the time to make all of what I have planned, so I only made an activity that show the details of a deadline and
wasn't able to implement the "Add" button for the deadline within my 8 hours, thus I will do it in the next sprint with the 
"Modify" button for the deadlines.

Sprint <n> summary
================

### Florian

### Joseph

### Lenny
I did functions to set notifications. I had no time to make test, If I stopped after half of the time to focus on making test, I'ld have nothing to test. Next sprint I'll work on testing notifications, which comes with a bunch of challenges.

### LÃ©o

### Louis
I finished the login and it's testing, i struggle with the CI and testing some result coming from 
online operation. Next sprint i'll work on log-out system, profile page and sorted deadline as done 
and undone.

Sprint 3 summary
================

### Florian

### Joseph

This week I was assigned to the implementation of the remote storage of the
list of deadlines.
Since the login system wasn't finished yet, I had to store the data globally,
which we will resolve next week to integrate Louis's work.
I almost managed to combine my code to Florian's work on the UI side,
but ended up short on time.
Lastly, I had some trouble understanding the asynchronous API of Firebase,
which from what I understand is untestable on the Java runtime, since
`Task`s are run on the Android runtime.
I switched back to a synchronous interface to get something merged.

### Lenny

### LÃ©o

### Louis

I finished the login and it's testing, i struggle with the CI. I didn't find a way to test result 
coming from google sign in, I assume this is not possible with our current framework. 
Next sprint i'll work on log-out system, profile page and sorted deadline as done and undone.

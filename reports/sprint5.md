Sprint <n> summary
================

### Florian
During this week, I was assigned to make an Add, Delete and Modify option for the Deadline.
In overall, it went well for the Add implementation. However, I had much more problems
for the Delete one, as I wanted to remove the deadline by swiping them left or right,
thus I have underestimated the time for this option and I didn't have the time to
do the Modify implementation. I have also discovered some errors in the DeadlineAdapter
during this sprint and thus I will, in the next sprint, do what I wasn't able to do in
addition to fix the adapter and improve it.
